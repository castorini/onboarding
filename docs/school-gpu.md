# School GPU Machines

We have access to a few DataSci GPU machines from the school. For access, SSH to the login node, `datasci.cs.uwaterloo.ca`, using your Waterloo user ID and password. From there, SSH to `gpu1`, `gpu2`, or `gpu3`.

```
ssh <WatID>@datasci.cs.uwaterloo.ca
ssh gpu1
```

### DataSci GPU1
```
Hostname: gpu1 from datasci.cs
Specifications: 2x P40 GPUs, 2x Xeon Silver 4114 CPUs.
```

### DataSci GPU2
```
Hostname: gpu2 from datasci.cs
Specifications: 2x P40 GPUs, 2x Xeon Silver 4114 CPUs.
```

### DataSci GPU3
```
Hostname: gpu3 from datasci.cs
Specifications: 2x P40 GPUs, 2x Xeon Silver 4114 CPUs.
