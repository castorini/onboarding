# Castorini: Onboarding Guide

"Castorini" is the GitHub organization of [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/)'s research group at the University of Waterloo.
The name is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_word) of castor, which is the genus name for a [beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver), and anserini, which is the genus name for a [goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anser_(bird)).
It's hard to come up with two animals that are as quintessentially Canadian as these!

This repository contains onboarding resources for researchers who would like to work with us, which include new graduate students and undergraduates at the University of Waterloo.

**Undergraduates at the University of Waterloo**: If you're interested in working with our group, read [this guide](ura.md).

## ðŸ§± Foundations of Retrieval

This onboarding path provides the starting point for working in our group and comprises the following lessons:

1. Begin your journey [here](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/start-here.md). 
2. [BM25 Baselines for MS MARCO Passage Ranking **in Anserini**](https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md).
3. [BM25 Baseline for MS MARCO Passage Ranking **in Pyserini**](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage.md).
4. [A Conceptual Framework for Retrieval](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/conceptual-framework.md)
5. [Contriever Baseline for NFCorpus](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/experiments-nfcorpus.md)
6. [A Deeper Dive into Dense and Sparse Representations](https://github.com/castorini/pyserini/blob/master/docs/conceptual-framework2.md)

When proceeding along the onboarding path, please _don't_ send a separate pull request for each file.
Instead, consolidate your edits into a single pull request for each repo.

## Resources

This repository introduces several methods for users without local GPU resources.

## Training monoBERT from Scratch

[This](https://github.com/capreolus-ir/capreolus/blob/feature/msmarco_psg/docs/reproduction/MS_MARCO.md) 
is the guide to fine-tuning monoBERT on [MS MARCO Passage](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking) dataset,
based on [Capreolus](https://capreolus.ai/) toolkit.
For Compute Canada users, 
you may need to set up the environment following [this](https://github.com/capreolus-ir/capreolus/blob/feature/msmarco_psg/docs/setup/setup-cc.md) guide.
